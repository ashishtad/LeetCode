LeetCode 1376: Time Needed to Inform All Employees.

The story in plain words

You have a company with n employees.

Every employee has one direct manager (except the head).

The head of the company is employee headID.

Each manager needs a certain amount of informTime[i] minutes to pass the news to all their direct subordinates.

Subordinates then repeat the process with their own teams.

We need to figure out:
👉 How much time will it take for the news to spread from the head to everyone in the company?

Key points

manager[i] = the manager of employee i.

If manager[i] = -1, that’s the head.

informTime[i] = time taken by manager i to inform all their direct subordinates.

Important: it doesn’t depend on how many subordinates there are — once a manager starts informing, all of their subordinates are informed in parallel after informTime[i] minutes.

The total time is basically the longest path from the head down to the leaf employees in this management tree.


n = 7
headID = 0
manager = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
informTime = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]


Step 1: Build the tree from manager

Head = employee 0

Subordinates:

0 → [1,2]

1 → [3,4]

2 → [5,6]

So the tree looks like:
         0 (2)
       /      \
     1 (2)    2 (1)
    /   \     /   \
  3(1) 4(1) 5(0)  6(0)

Step 2: Simulate spreading

At t = 0: Employee 0 (head) starts informing.

At t = 2: Employees 1 and 2 are informed (since informTime[0] = 2).

From Employee 1:

At t = 2: Employee 1 starts.

At t = 4: Employees 3 and 4 are informed (needs 2 more minutes).

They each take 1 more minute, so:

At t = 5: Employees 3 and 4 finish.

From Employee 2:

At t = 2: Employee 2 starts.

At t = 3: Employees 5 and 6 are informed (needs 1 more minute).

Since their informTime=0, they’re done immediately.

Step 3: Total time

Longest path =

0 → 1 → 3 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5

0 → 1 → 4 = 5

0 → 2 → 5 = 3

0 → 2 → 6 = 3

⏱️ Total time = 5 minutes
