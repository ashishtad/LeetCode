Approach:

1.Find the middle element of the linked list. This can be done by using two pointers, one that moves one step at a time and another that moves two steps at a time. When the faster pointer reaches the end of the list, the slower pointer will be pointing to the middle element.

2.Create a new node with the value of the middle element, and make it the root of the binary search tree.

3.Recursively convert the left half of the linked list to the left subtree of the root, and the right half of the linked list to the right subtree of the root.

4.To convert the left half of the linked list, recursively repeat steps 1-3 on the sublist of elements to the left of the middle element.

5.To convert the right half of the linked list, recursively repeat steps 1-3 on the sublist of elements to the right of the middle element.

6.Return the root of the binary search tree.

Time Complexity:
Finding the Middle Node (findMidNode function):

The findMidNode function takes linear time, O(n), to find the middle node of the linked list, where n is the number of nodes between head and tail.
Since the linked list is divided recursively, each recursive call splits the list into two halves, resulting in log(n) levels of recursion.
Recursive Construction of the BST (buildBST function):

At each level of recursion, the linked list is split in half, and finding the middle node takes O(n) time.
Since there are log(n) levels of recursion, the total time complexity becomes O(n * log(n)).
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n * log(n)).

Space Complexity:
Recursive Call Stack:

The depth of the recursion is O(log(n)), as the linked list is divided in half at each level.
This contributes to a space complexity of O(log(n)) due to the recursive call stack.
Auxiliary Space for Nodes:

The BST itself is constructed in-place, meaning no extra data structures are used besides the tree nodes.
Since the new nodes are allocated on the heap, this does not contribute to the function's call stack space complexity.
Thus, the overall space complexity is O(log(n)) due to the depth of the recursive call stack.
