/*
     47. Permutations II
    Here we can't sort the nums and use the check if(i > index && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) does not work correctly because:

    It is applied in a loop that modifies nums (due to swapping).
    It does not prevent duplicate permutations fully when nums[i] has already been used in the recursion.
    This condition is only useful when choosing elements from a sorted array without modifying their order, but here, swaps reorder elements dynamically.

    Solution:
    To figure out the duplicates , we should use a set or a unordered_set<int> to track used elements at each recursion level.
    Time complexity : O(N * N!) : N! is the total no of permuations and each permuation is of N length.
    Space complexity: O(N * N!) 
        Recursive Call Stack:

        The recursion depth is O(N) because at each step, we increment index by 1.
        So, the worst-case recursive stack usage is O(N).
        Result Storage (vector<vector<int>> result):

        We are storing N! unique permutations, each of size N.
        This contributes O(N Ã— N!) space.
        Temporary Data Structures (unordered_set<int> used):

        This is used once per level of recursion and holds at most N elements.
        This contributes O(N) space per recursion level, but since it does not persist beyond each recursive call, it is O(N) in the worst case.
