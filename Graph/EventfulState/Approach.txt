Solution-1. Eventful_safe_states.cpp

Here the approach is to solve the problem by topological sort.
Hence we need to reverse the graph and perform the usual topological sort.
Space complexity: O(V+E) as new reverse graph needs to be constructed.

Solution-2 Eventful_state_solution2.cpp

Here the approach is perform a recursive DFS from starting node.
Meanwhile while traversing the neighbour nodes, construct a safe map
so that by the time we reach one terminal node, we would already have
results for some of the other noeds in path.
And hash map can be used to traverse the nodes while determining if node
is already processed or not. If node is present in map it's already processed so skip it.
