This problem could not be solved by DFS.
This is multi source BFS problem where we need to do BFS simultaneously from two nodes( in this problem).

Solution:
Traverse the grid and :
1. Identify the total fresh oranges in the grid.
2. Push the rotten oranges cordinates in queue.

Traverse the queue till it's empty:
3. Mark the adjacent oranges as rotten and increment the time.
4. If no fresh oranges left return the time else return -1
